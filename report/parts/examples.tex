\subsection{Transport with a soft target}

\subsubsection{Two-marginal case}

We start with a very simplified approximation of the crowd displacement problem on $\Omega = [0, 1]^2$, with only the first step (with initial agent distribution) and final step decided by the terminal penalty function $G$.

We set $G$ to be the obstacle constraint  related to a subset $\mathscr{O}$ of $\Omega$ as well as a potential $\Psi(x) = d(x, \mathscr A)^{\beta}$ for some $\beta > 0$, related to the distance to a target subset $\mathscr{A}$ (see \cref{fig:CrowdExamplePotential}):
\[
	G(\mu) = \int_\Omega \Psi\,d\mu + \imath_{0}(\mu\mathds{1}_{\mathscr O})
\]
Thus, the agents engage in a one-round mean-field game where they are only concerned with moving to regions with lower potential $\Psi$ -- as close as possible to $\mathscr{A}$ -- whilst obeying physical constraints related to the obstacles.

The discretized MFG problem with viscosity parameter $\epsilon = \sigma^2$ can be written as the following transport problem:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2MargFuzzyObstacleObj}
\begin{aligned}
	&\inf_\gamma{} \langle \Psi, \gamma^T\mathds{1}\rangle + \epsilon \KL(\gamma | \bfR) \\
	\suchthat\ & \gamma\mathds{1} = \rho_0, \quad \gamma^T\mathds{1} \odot \mathds{1}_{\mathscr{O}} = 0
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
In this two-marginal case, the matrix $\bfR = \bfP$ is the discretization of the heat kernel $P_h$ as discussed in \cref{sec:PartialDiscret}:
\[
	\bfR_{i,j} = P_{h\epsilon}(x_j - x_i)
\]
for all grid indices $i,j$.



In this problem we want to observe the optimal target distribution $\rho^*_1 = (\gamma^*)^T\mathds{1}$ the agents reach at the final time $t=1$.

\begin{prop}\label{thm:2MargFuzzyTarget}
Problem \eqref{eq:2MargFuzzyObstacleObj} can be solved in closed form: the Lagrange multiplier $u_0^*$ for the marginal law constraint satisfies
\[
	a_0^* = e^{-u_0^*/\epsilon}  = \frac{\rho_0}{\bfR a^*_1}
\]
where $a^*_1 = e^{-\Psi/\epsilon}\odot\mathds{1}_{\Omega\backslash\mathscr{O}}$, and the optimal coupling is
\[
	\gamma^* = \bfR\odot (a_0^* \otimes a_1^*)	
\]
It satisfies, as expected, that $\gamma^*_{i,j} = 0$ for all $j\in\mathscr{O}$. The final distribution of agents is
\[
	\rho_1 = \gamma^T\mathds{1} = a_1^* \odot \bfR a_0^*
\]
\end{prop}
 
\paragraph{Numerical experiment} We ran a numerical experiment by implementing the solutions given by \cref{thm:2MargFuzzyTarget} to the discrete MFG \eqref{eq:2MargFuzzyObstacleObj}. \cref{fig:2MargFuzzyTransportObstacles} provides a representation of both . We also checked the results when removing the constraints on the obstacles (essentially setting $\mathscr{O}$), and when lowering the viscosity parameter $\sigma = \sqrt{\epsilon}$ (see \cref{fig:2MargFuzzyTransportRelaxedObst,fig:2MargFuzzyTransportLowVisc}).

Since the kernel $\bfR$ on the domain is separable, the convolution can be sped up \cite[ch.~4]{peyr2018computational}.

\begin{remark}[A ``smarter" (more realistic) potential for crowd dynamics]\label{rmk:SmartPotential} The results shown \cref{fig:2MargFuzzyTransportMarginals} are satisfactory for the given potential $\Psi$ -- as expected the agents try to stay near the low-potential regions. However, for modeling of crowd dynamics they would be deeply nonphysical because the potential is inadequate. In a room evacuation scenario, for instance, agents would seek to minimize the time-to-exit: the literature shows this leads to the Eikonal equation, a kind of Hamilton-Jacobi PDE. We computed the adequate potential shown \cref{fig:CrowdShortedPathPotential} using the Fast Sweeping method \parencite{Zhao2004AFS}, as well as the discrete MFG \cref{fig:2MargEikonalGame}.

\subsubsection{Three time steps}

We now go up to three marginals $(\rho_0,\rho_1,\rho_2)$. We assign to the single intermediate marginal $\rho_1$ the congestion constraint $\rho_1 \leq \bar{m}$ and the obstacle constraint. The primal problem then reads
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	&\inf_{\gamma,\rho_1,\rho_2}{} \langle \Psi, \rho_2\rangle + \epsilon \KL(\gamma | \bfR) \\
	\suchthat \ & P^k_\#\gamma = \rho_k,\; k = 0,1,2 \\
	& \rho_1 \leq \bar{m} \\
	& \rho_1\odot\mathds{1}_{\mathscr O} = 0\\
	& \rho_2\odot\mathds{1}_{\mathscr O} = 0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Contraction/convolution with the kernel $\bfR$ in this case satisfies
\[
\begin{aligned}
	&\bfR[\cdot,v,w] = 
	\mathbf{P} (v \odot \mathbf{P}w) \\
	&\bfR[u,\cdot,w]
	= (\mathbf{P}^Tu) \odot (\mathbf{P}w)  \\
	&\bfR[u, v, \cdot] = 
	\mathbf{P}^T (v \odot \mathbf{P}^T u)
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin{prop}
The Lagrange multipliers $u_i^*$ at the optimum satisfy the fixed-point conditions:
\begin{align*}
	&a_0^* = \frac{\rho_0}{\bfR[\,\cdot\,, a_1^*, a_2^*]} \\
	&a_1^* = \min\left(
	\frac{\bar{m}}{\bfR[a_0^*, \,\cdot\,, a_2^*]}, 1\right)
\end{align*}
where $a_i^* = \exp(-u_i^*)$, $a_1^*$ is supported on $\Omega\backslash\mathscr{O}$ and $a_2^* = e^{-\Psi/\epsilon}\odot\mathds{1}_{\Omega\backslash\mathscr{O}}$, and we denote $\bfR[\cdot,\cdot,\cdot]$ the appropriate tensor contraction by $\bfR$.

The marginals are obtained as
\[
	\rho_1^* =
	a_1^* \odot
	\bfR[a_0^*, \,\cdot\,, a_2^*] =
	a_1^* \odot
	(\mathbf{P}^Ta_0^*) \odot
	(\mathbf{P}a_2^*)
\]
and
\[
	\rho_2^* = 
	a_2^* \odot \bfR[a_0^*, a_1^*, \,\cdot\,]
	= a_2^* \odot
	\mathbf{P}^T
	(a_1^* \odot \mathbf{P}^Ta_0^*)
\]
\end{prop}



The fixed point can then computed using an iterative algorithm Ã  la generalized Sinkhorn, just as in the Algorithm \autoref{algo:Algo1} suggested by \cite{benamou2018entropy}.

The issue of computational efficiency is more pronounced here than before due to the tensor product and need for multiple iterations until convergence.
