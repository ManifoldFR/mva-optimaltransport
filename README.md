Work for the MVA course "Computational Optimal Transport' https://optimaltransport.github.io/

## Numerical tours

Install the toolbox [from here](http://www.numerical-tours.com/installation_python/).


## Final project: entropy minimization approach for MFGs


I wrote a module implementing the Fast Sweeping Method to solve the Eikonal equation for the crowd congestion problem. It was written in Cython. It can be built using
```bash
cd project/
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
